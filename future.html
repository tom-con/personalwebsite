        <h2>Starting an Education Non-profit in Bhutan</h2>
        <h4>Where my head, heart, and hands meet</h4>
        <p>My eventual dream is to run an education-based non-profit in Bhutan that seeks to integrate the cultural traditions and societal values with modern pedagogies, technology, and other resources. I have dreamed about this since first living in Bhutan in 2015 for six months. While I was there I met a great friend, Chencho. Together we shared our hopes to change the world for the better, starting in his home of Bhutan. We especially hope to serve children in rural Bhutan who do not have the same access to educational opportunites and resources as their peers in the more urban regions. We also hope to incorporate mindfulness meditation and Buddhist psychology as underpinnings of our pedagogies. Hopefully, by initially leveraging Western resources and donations, we can create a sustainable future by integrating with the greater community in Bhutan.</p>

        <h4 class="left">A fight against economic disparity</h4><br>
        <p>I would love to help create web apps that expose economic injustice, whether it be at a global, national, or local level. I feel that one of the greatest hindrances to people being able to combat the increasing global and national wealth inequality is two-part. The first is the lack of information that is readily accessible and intelligible to the public. The second is the multitude of streams in which economic disparity compounds. I would like to help create apps that make available the resources people need to be informed about and organized against economic oppression.</p>
