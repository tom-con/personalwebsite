            <h2>Bio</h2><!--
            --><p>I was born in England in 1991, making me 25 years old now. When I was 11, my family and I moved to the DC/Baltimore area where I stayed until going to <a href="http://www.psu.edu/">Penn State University</a> in 2009, studying <a href="http://hhd.psu.edu/shm">Hotel, Restaurant, and Institutional Management</a>. After about 3.5 years I realized I wasn't having much fun, so I took two years off. During that time I worked in restaurants as a manager. I moved to Boulder, CO in 2014 and managed two restaurants on 16th and Pearl st., <a href="http://ajirestaurant.com/">Aji Latin American Restaurant</a> and <a href="http://leafvegetarianrestaurant.com/">Leaf Vegitarian Restaurant</a>. <img src="assets/images/home/mebhu.jpg" alt="Tom in Bhutan">In August of 2014 I joined <a href="http://www.naropa.edu/">Naropa University</a> and decided to study Buddhist Psychology and Intercultural Communication. During my time at Naropa, I studied abroad in the small himalayan kingdom of Bhutan twice, which became a pivotal experience in my life. During that time I met my wife, Kencho who now lives with me in Longmont.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I have varied interests and hobbies. I have been a rock climber since I was 10, but these days I can only find time once or twice a week to get out. <img src="assets/images/home/meroc.jpg" alt="Tom rock climbing aged 16"> I also mountain bike on trails around Boulder, Denver, Breckenridge, and Winter Park (I especially love downhilling in the summer here). I have played video games since I was really young, and therefore still do! I like <em>all</em> types of games, but especially those with rich stories, game mechanics, or multiplayer aspects. I also like to read, especially books by authors with whom I don't share a cultural background so that I can learn more about different perspectives. A recent favorite was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vegetarian-Novel-Han-Kang/dp/1101906111/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1484605035&sr=1-1&keywords=the+vegetarian">The Vegitarian, by Han Kang</a>. Right now I am reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Life-Hanya-Yanagihara/dp/0804172706/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1484605001&sr=1-1&keywords=a+little+life">A Little Life, by Hanya Yanagihara</a>.</p>

            <h2>My Gif</h2>
            <p>This is my beautiful, wonderful gif. I love him like a child. He has always been there for me, and I couldn't imagine where I would be in my life without him. <img src="assets/images/home/source.gif" alt="gif"></p>
